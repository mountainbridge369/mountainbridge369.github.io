								<p>I was born in Hong Kong in a town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Po_District">Tai Po</a>. I spent my formative years there until I moved to the US with my family when I was 15. When I first arrived in San Francisco, I spent one semester at Newcomer High School (an interesting social experiment, now <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/S-F-may-close-Newcomer-High-for-immigrants-3273454.php">permanently closed</a>) before transferring to <a href="https://sites.google.com/prod/sfusd.edu/gwhs">George Washington High School</a> in the Richmond district of San Francisco. While I was at Wash, I also attended evening classes at City College of San Francisco through their dual enrollment program, which was really an eye-opening experience. I took classes in physical anthropology, harmony, planetary science, and calculus. I was quite determined to pursue a career in astronomy when I first got to Berkeley in 1995, but I quickly got sidetracked after George Lakoff's Ling 105 Language and Mind, which I took to satisfy the Philosophy distribution requirement. That class introduced me to the world of Cognitive Science and Linguistics. I was planning to declare CogSci as my new major, but then I took <a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/sharon-inkelas">Sharon Inkelas</a>’ Ling 115 (Intro to Morphology and Phonology), which convinced me that Linguistics is what I should focus on instead. Around that time, I was lucky enough to have landed a job as one of the part-time lab managers in the Phonology Laboratory. <a href="https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/">John Ohala</a>, the director of the Phonology Lab at the time, was a very kind and supportive mentor who treated me as a full member of the lab. I got a front row seat to all the actions in lab (e.g., how to prepare grant proposals, how to carry out research projects from the beginning to the end, how to run a conference [the lab was busy preparing for the <a href="https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/icphs-proceedings/ICPhS1999/index.html">ICPhS in 1999</a> at the time]). This experience made me realized for the first time that it is possible for someone like me to pursue a career as an academic. While I was strongly encouraged by many to go elsewhere for grad school, I ultimately decided to stay at Berkeley. I was fortunate enough to be supported by a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>, which allowed me to focus on research.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Berkeley was, and continues to be, a popular place for visiting scholars to spend their sabbaticals and retirement. I benefited tremendously from my interactions with these visitors, chief among them <a href="https://julietteblevins.ws.gc.cuny.edu/">Juliette Blevins</a>, <a href="https://asyras2017uab.wordpress.com/conference/plenary-speakers/dr-maria-josep-sole/">Maria-Josep Solé</a>, and Donca Steriade. They greatly influenced my thinking about the relationship between phonetics and phonology. By 2001, I was in the thick of dissertation writing. After an unsuccessful job-hunting season, I was antsy about having already spent 7 years at Berkeley and wanted to gain some fresh perspectives. I ended up taking a one-year position at McGill in 2022, teaching phonetics and phonology and historical linguistics. That year in Montreal was definitely an eye-opening experience for me, teaching full-time, adjusting to a foreign city by myself away from family for the first time, and desparately looking for a more secured job. It was a trying time, but I enjoyed living in Montreal tremendously, exploring this very vibrant city. I also had a great time hanging out with Mark Hale, Glyne Piggott, and Charles Reiss, and made many good friends among the senior grad students in that department at the time, particularly, <a href="https://scholarworks.brandeis.edu/esploro/profile/lotus_goldberg">Lotus Goldberg</a> and Naoko Tomioka.
                                </p>
                                <p>It was a small miracle that I managed to complete my first year of teaching full time and returned to Berkeley unscathed, and defended my dissertation, with the guidiance of my amazing advisor, Sharon Inkelas, and the very supportive committee members, <a href="https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/garrett/">Andrew Garrett</a>, Juliette Blevins, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna_Nichols">Johanna Nichols</a>. A twist of fate led me to my dream job at the University of Chicago in 2003. I started the Washo Documentation Project there, which allowed me to work with many talented field linguists, including <a href="https://linguistics.ubc.ca/profile/ryan-bochnak/">Ryan Bochnak</a> and <a href="https://emhanink.pages.iu.edu/">Emily Hanink</a>. I rose through the ranks, got tenure in 2008. I co-directed the <a href="https://lsa2015.uchicago.edu/">Linguistics Institute</a>, with the amazing Karlos Arregi, in 2015. In 2022, I became a co-General Editor, along with Lisa Davidson, of <a href="https://www.journal-labphon.org/">Laboratory Phonology</a>, the official journal of the <a href="https://labphon.org/">Association for Laboratory Phonology</a>. I have worked with many talented <a href="http://ayluna.github.io/index.html#advising">students</a> over the years and collaborated (and continue to collaborate) with many wonderful colleagues, especially the incredible psycholinguist, <a href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/">Ming Xiang</a> (I learned so much from her over the years!). I also chaired that department between 2023 and 2025. 
				</p>	<p>
				I was in Chicago for 22 years until another twist of fate brought me back to Berkeley in 2025, where I am now Chancellor's Professor of Linguistics and director of the very same Phonology Lab that kick-started my academic journey.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Behavioral and neurophysiological investigations of individual variation in cue weighting strategies</strong> (Previously supported by National Science Foundation #1827409 in collaboration with Ming Xiang and Jinghua Ou)</p>

                               <p> The perception of speech sounds often requires listeners to pay attention to multiple cues at once. The weighting of the relative importance of cues can nonetheless vary across individuals. Little is known regarding the sources of such variation, however. This project will investigate potential mechanisms underpinning such variability. The project will broaden the empirical database on which theories of speech perception and production are grounded as well as providing insights into first/second language acquisition and pedagogy in terms of the development of personalized training for individual language learners. The project will also introduce young women and under-represented minorities to STEM fields via the study of the language sciences through planned outreach programs. The findings from this project may inform clinical research on developmental or acquired perceptual and language impairments, and may also serve to inform research on speech related technologies.
</p>
<p>
                                This project focuses on two potential explanations for individual variability in cue weighting. Listeners might differ in early auditory encoding, which affects the reliability, hence weighting, of certain cues that support phonological contrasts. Listeners might also differ in cue integration strategy such that some utilize a continuous cue integration strategy whereby cue information is integrated as they become available, while others might employ a buffer strategy so that phonemic identification is postponed until all necessary information becomes available. This project will investigate individual variability in cue weighting using brainstem and cortical responses to speech sounds within the same individual, thus providing a comprehensive neurophysiological profile that underlies individual patterns of real-time cue weighting process, as measured with eye-movements</p>

                                    <p><strong>Comparative Cantonese Acquisition: Ethnic Minorities, Recent Immigrants, and Local Chinese Families in Hong Kong (in collaboration with Carol To at Hong Kong University and Yao Yao at Polytechnic University of Hong Kong)</strong></p>

                                <p>Hong Kong has seen a continuous increase in the number of local children born to ethnic minority families with South Asian heritage and Chinese families that migrated from the mainland. These children speak a minority language as their mother tongue and belong to a minority culture within a larger community.
</p>
<p>
                                This project aims to examine the relationship between the language input received by these young children and the language the children are producing based on data in the Multi-ethnic Hong Kong Cantonese Corpus (MeHKCC). Specifically, we seek to study the quantity and quality of the Cantonese used by the children towards their caregivers and the Cantonese input from those caregivers. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a comparative corpus of Cantonese child speech as well as child directed speech (CDS) between toddlers and mothers who speak a South Asian language, Putonghua or local Cantonese as first language (L1); (2) to demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative differences of Cantonese produced by these three groups of children and mothers as they interact with each other; (3) to identify the contribution of variant pronunciations in Cantonese among the three groups in the recent sound changes in Hong Kong Cantonese (HKC).

                                    <p><strong>The Linguistic Characteristics of Autism in Hong Kong: A Corpus Approach (in collaboration with Carol To at Hong Kong University)</strong></p>

                                <p>There is a fundamental gap in understanding the nature of speech production in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), even though atypical language use is a core symptom in the clinical presentation and evaluation of ASD. The situation is even more acute for the speech production of ASD individuals whose native language is Cantonese as most research on ASD has been focused on English and other Western languages. Even within the Chinese context, ASD research has focused mainly on speakers of Mandarin, rather than other varieties of Chinese. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to further understanding of the precise phonetic characteristics of what constitutes patterns of atypical speech in Cantonese-speaking ASD individuals. The proposed research is significantbecause it will improve understanding and recognition of the clinical presentation of ASD in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform the design of diagnostic and assessment tools to better capture the presence and severity of ASD symptoms among native Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area. In addition, the methods proposed will enable analysis of more representative and ecologically valid natural language samples, and may create opportunities for discovery of currently unknown speech features in individuals with ASD.</p>
